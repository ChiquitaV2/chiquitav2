### About
Hey, I'm [ChiquitaV2](https://chiquitav2.com) a self taught developer. My pronouns are he/her. I like to work on Minecraft clients, Discord bots, and anything else that peeks my interests. If you need to contact me hit up my discord ChiquitaV2#3814, but I am currently taking a break from Discord, so [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Chiquita_V2) dms are a better way of reaching me. Low key have stopped using github for vsc.
